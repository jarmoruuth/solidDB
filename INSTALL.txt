How to Compile and Install the SolidDB 5.5 Plugin
=================================================

The SolidDB storage engine plugin is based on the Solid Database (Boost Engine) now owned by Unicom.
SolidDB provides a fully ACID-compliant transactional storage engine offering different levels
of transaction isolation. The multiversion concurrency control is achieved through a unique design
known as a Bonsai Tree. 

Advantages seen in SolidDB plugin include:

* Fully multithreaded to scale across cpu's
* Scales well with high concurrency loads
* Hot backup available via MySQL commands
* Cost-based optimizer builtin
* On-the-fly debugging available

1. Compile SolidDB Plugin

This source package has been developed to run on all MySQL supported platforms including Linux,
Solaris, Windows platforms, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. The method is the same for all platforms.

1.1 Unarchiving the Source Tarball

shell> cd /usr/local/src/mysql-5.5.17
shell> tar xvf ~/Downloads/soliddb_5.5_plugin_source.tar.gz

This will create a new storage engine directory called 'soliddb' in the main source tree.

1.2 Create Make files

Generate the platform specific make configuration.

shell> cmake .

1.3 Make and Install

Compile the complete source and install.

shell> make
shell> sudo make install

Then start the service.

2. Installing the Plugin

Once the source has been compiled and installed the plugin is available, but not yet loaded.
To load the plugin, use the standard INSTALL PLUGIN command:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN soliddb SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";

The plugin also has INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables for added information. These need to be loaded
from the main plugin using the following commands:

mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_TABLES       SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_COLUMNS      SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_KEYS         SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_KEYPARTS     SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_COLUMNS_AUX  SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_KEYPARTS_AUX SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_FORKEYS      SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_FORKEYPARTS  SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_SCHEMAS      SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_SEQUENCES    SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_CARDINAL     SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_TABLEMODES   SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_INFO         SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";
mysql> INSTALL PLUGIN SOLIDDB_SYS_BLOBS        SONAME "ha_soliddb.so";

Note: The installation only needs to be done once and the system stores the details in the
mysql.plugin table which MySQL loads each time the server starts.

3. Testing the Plugin

Check that the plugins have loaded without any issue:

mysql> SHOW PLUGINS;
